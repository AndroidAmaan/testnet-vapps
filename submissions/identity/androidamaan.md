## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project:** ProofLink  
- **Category:** Identity / DeFi  

### Description
ProofLink solves the problem of Sybil attacks and fake users in crypto airdrops and incentive programs.  
It creates a decentralized reputation system that links wallet activity, off-chain data, and Soundness Layer proofs to ensure fairness.

### SL Integration
We will use Soundness Layer for:  
- Zero-knowledge proofs of wallet uniqueness.  
- SL-based verification for transaction reputation.  
- Secure user identity mapping without exposing private data.

## Technical

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Web dApp (React + Tailwind)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Blockchain:** SL + Base + Ethereum + Sui  
- **Storage:** WALRUS + IPFS for proof and reputation records  

### Features
- Wallet uniqueness proof  
- Reputation score dashboard  
- Sybil detection API for projects  

### Timeline
**PoC (2-4 weeks)**  
- Wallet connection + basic reputation logic  
- SL proof integration  
- Simple React UI  

**MVP (4-8 weeks)**  
- Full dashboard with Sybil detection  
- API for projects to integrate  
- User testing with testnet wallets  

### Innovation
ProofLink is unique because it combines on-chain reputation with Soundness Layer proofs to give projects a plug-and-play way to avoid Sybil farmers.  
People will use it because it ensures fair rewards and reduces bot abuse.
